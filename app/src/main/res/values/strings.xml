1. Check for responsiveness: Tap the person and shout, "Are you okay?"\n
2. Call for help: Dial emergency services (e.g., 911) for assistance.\n
3. Start chest compressions: Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person\'s chest, interlock your fingers, and compress hard and fast at least 2 inches deep.\n
4. Give rescue breaths: After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths by tilting the head back, lifting the chin, and sealing your mouth over the person's mouth to deliver breaths.\n
5. Continue cycles: Keep performing cycles of compressions and rescue breaths until help arrives or the person starts breathing.
